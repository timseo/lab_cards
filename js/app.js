// Make a deck of cards.

// 1. Make an array of suits.

// 2. Make an array of values.

// 3. Write a constructor function for Card which takes two arguments, suit and val. Include a stateValue method to return the card's suit and value in a concatenated string.

// 4. Using iteration, build a deck of cards.

// 5. Add an event listener to console.log the deck object and the deck length when a specific button is clicked (don't forget to create the button in your HTML!)


//////////////////////////////////
//           PART 2             //
//////////////////////////////////

// Make a list of animals in a shelter.

// 1. Make a constructor function for animals that takes name, species, breed, and available as arguments.

// 2. Make three animals and save them each to variables.

// 3. Make an object to represent the shelter. Give it a name, location, and an empty list of animals.

// 4. Add the animals that you made in step 2 to the shelter that you made in step 3.

// 5. Add an event listener to console.log the shelter object when a specific button is clicked (don't forget to create the button in your HTML!)

//////////////////////////////////
//           PART 3             //
//////////////////////////////////

// Make a list of animals in a shelter again, but this time, use prototypes.

// 1. Make a constructor function for animals that takes no arguments. Its only property is an identify function which returns a string stating its name and species.

// 2. Make a Cat prototype which inherits from Animal. The constructor function should take three arguments: name, available, and breed.

// 3. Repeat step 2 for Dog.

// 4. Make three animals using the Cat and Dog prototypes and save them each to variables.

// 5. Make an object to represent the shelter. Give it a name, location, and an empty list of animals.

// 6. Add the animals that you made in step 4 to the shelter that you made in step 5.

// 7. Add an event listener to console.log the shelter object when a specific button is clicked (don't forget to create the button in your HTML!)
